# my-os
Trying to build an os from scratch based on https://wiki.osdev.org/Creating_an_Operating_System#Phase_0:_Introduction

The reason for this project is to learn as many things as possible about how an OS is made. I don't want to build anything too complex (for now). I just wanna learn the basics so that I can better understand how the linux kernel is working and how I can possibly modify it.
